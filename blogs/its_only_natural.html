	<h1><span> </span>Natural Transformations: Why are Natural Transformations Natural?</h1>

	<p>I am a member of Colorado State's Applied category theorey seminar, and every semester we talk about the basic definitions in category theory.
        I have been trying to become a better mathematician, trying to better understand not the "what" but the "why". In this particular seminar I have put a lot
        of though into categories without objects. I wont talk about that too much here but it may affect my language. Anyway I have been thinking a lot about naturality,
        as it is supposedly(maybe controversially) the primary objective of category theory.
    </p>	
    <p>My new found understanding of natural is partially motivated by algebra and some of the forgotten definitions there, such as inner homomorphisms. Never the less
        I think the notion of inner gives a very informative foundation for what it means to be natural.
    </p>
	<h3>When is a Functor Inner? and what does that even mean?</h3>
    <p>For some motivation lets look at the term "Inner"
in the context of groups to get some motivation for why we might want a similar term in 
the world of categories. 
</p>

<p>A group automorphism $\phi:G\ra G$ is called an inner automorphism if $\phi(g)=x^{-1}gx$ for 
some fixed element $x\in G$. Inner automorphisms are the automorphisms that are really coming 
from conjugation. A Group $G$ can act on its self by conjugation, and for each element the actions 
by elements give us the inner automorphisms. These are very special automorphisms because they come 
from with\textit{in} the group. In a sense the group already knew about these particular automorphisms.
Furthermore conjugation in groups often looks like relabeling. For example consider the permutation $(1,5)(2,4,7,8)$
conjugated by $(1,2,3,4)$, which would be
$$(1,2,3,4)^{-1}\cdot(1,5)(2,4,7,8)\cdot(1,2,3,4)=(1,7,8,3)(2,5)=(2,5)(3,1,7,8)$$
We can see that the structure hasn't changed drasticly but we have relabeled $1,2,3$ and $4$
</p>

<p>These are really the key idea behind the term "Inner", they refer to things that are coming from within 
the algebraic object you are studying, and dont change the underlying structure is a significant way. 
So how does this apply to functors? We lets look at some diagrams 
and try to deduce what inner could possible mean.
</p>

<p>Consider a functor $F:C\ra C$ that maps a morphism $f$ to the morphism $Ff$

$$\begin{tikzcd}
        \cdot \arrow[r, "f"]
        & \cdot \\
        \cdot \arrow[r, "Ff"]
        & \cdot
    \end{tikzcd}$$
</p>
<p>
To call this functor inner, it should have more or less the same idea as in the case of groups. Where the 
morphism $f\in C$ is related to morphism $Ff\in C$ by some sort of "conjugation". And this conjugation should 
more or less behave like a relabeling, and should affect the underlying structure in a significant way.
But we have to be a bit more careful here as what ever we choose to do will depend on the sources and 
targets of the morphism $f$, as they determine when we can and cant compose with $f$. So we may want to enforce that the functor
maps morphism according to other morphisms already in the category $C$. Lets add in objects to help contextualize what is going one here.
</p>
<p>
Our functor $F$ is a mapping a morphism $f:a\ra b$ to the morephims $Ff:Fa\ra Fb$ but now we will enforce that for the object $a$ and $b$, 
the sources and targets of $f$, that there are morphisms $\phi_a:a\ra Fa$ and $\phi_b:b\ra Fb$ that create the following commuting square

 
$$
\begin{tikzcd}
        a \arrow[r, "f"]\arrow[d, "\phi_a"]
        & b \arrow[d, "\phi_b"]\\
        Fa \arrow[r, "Ff"]
        & Fb
    \end{tikzcd}
$$
</p>
<p>
algebraically this is telling us about a commuting $\phi_b \circ f = Ff \circ \phi_a$. In a sense this is telling us 
that the morphism $f$ is equivalent to the morphism $Ff$ up to some morphisms applied to the source and target, and 
we can think about this as being similar to just relabeling the sources and targets. Infact if $\phi_a$ was invertible 
this would give us an explicit conjugation $\phi_b \circ f \circ \phi_a^{-1}= Ff$.
</p>
<p>
So now we can define what inner will mean in the context of categories. An \textbf{inner endofunctor} is a functor $F: C \ra C$ 
along with a collection of maps $\{\phi_a | a\text{ an object of }C\}$ for each object(each source and target) 
such that for every morphism $f:a\ra b$ we have
$$\begin{tikzcd}
        a \arrow[r, "f"]\arrow[d, "\phi_a"]
        & b \arrow[d, "\phi_b"]\\
        Fa \arrow[r, "Ff"]
        & Fb
    \end{tikzcd}$$
</p>
<p>
Again this is really telling us that the morphisms $f$ and $Ff$ agree is some way internal to the category, by other morphism of the category.
</p>
<p>
Maybe in a future post I will give an object free definition. But i may just skip to adjoint functor which is where i believe the object free definition are nicer.

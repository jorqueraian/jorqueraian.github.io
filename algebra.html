	<h3>What is Algebra?</h3>
	<p>I really don't know! Some may say that algebra is the study of equations, and although this may be partially true I believe it misses the point. There is something more to being an "algebraist" that simply studying equations doesn't explain.</p>
	<p>This page is here to document my journey in becoming an "algebraist" and to describe my process in discovering what algebra is. Before I begin I would like to thank my fellow graduate students at Colorado State University for their valuable feedback!</p>
	<p>The following are a few of the ideas I've picked up along the way that are essential to being an "Algebraist"</p>
	<h3>Necessary things to understand to be an "Algebraist"</h3>
	<ul class="dotted">
		<li><span style='color:black;'><b>Algebra is when you quotient out the things that don't work!</b></span><br>
			<span style='color:black;'>This is pretty self explanatory so I won't go into details</span>
		</li><br>
		<li><span style='color:black;'><b>Algebra is when idempotents except maybe when nilpotents.</b></span><br>
			<span style='color:black;'>This took me a while to realize but yet it one of the most crucial pieces to being an "algebraist"</span>
		</li>
		<li><span style='color:black;'><b>Algebra is when Tensor Hom.</b></span><br>
			<span style='color:black;'>Because it shows up everywhere!</span>

    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>My name is Ian Jorquera. I am currently pursuing a PhD, as a GEM fellow, in mathematics at <a href="https://mathematics.colostate.edu/"><u>Colorado State University</u></a> 
        advised by <a href="https://www.math.colostate.edu/~king/"><u>Emily J. King</u></a>. I am also an active participant in the 
        <a href="https://csu-applied-category-theory.github.io/"><u>Applied Category Theory seminar</u></a> and a previous tea time team member.</p>
    <p>I graduated from the University of Colorado Boulder with a BA in Computer Science and a BA in Mathematics and a minor in Applied Mathematics.</p>
    <h3>Research Interests</h3>
    <p>Frame Theory, Algebraic Combinatorics, Applied Category Theory, Type Theory, and becoming an "algebraist"</p>
    <p>My research interests are currently in study of the structure of frames over finite fields. Recently I have been focusing on the matroidal structure of 
        frames over finite fields.</p>
    <p>I also just like math, and do math to do math.</p>
